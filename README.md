# Moses

Moses is a rescue coordination software bundle developed during the University of Toronto Engineering Kompetitions (UTEK) 2025. Built using Flutter, the app allows users to submit detailed rescue requests, specifying the number of people needing help, the number of injured individuals, and the danger level on a scale of 1 to 10. These reports are stored in Supabase, and later processed using Python algorithms. Our Python backend employs object-oriented programming principles and optimization techniques to assign responders efficiently based on proximity and the criticality of each request.

This project demonstrates a seamless integration of Flutter for a responsive interface, Supabase for reliable data management, and Python for intelligent decision-making. Within the competition timeframe, we successfully created a scalable system that prioritizes user needs and coordinates rescues in emergencies. Future enhancements aim to include real-time responder tracking, machine learning for danger assessment, and broader localization support to make Moses even more impactful.
